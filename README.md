# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
### Here are some of the projects that I made using C# and .NET Framework

* Newsletter appication
* Car Insurance application

### Newsletter App  
This project is an MVC web application that acts as a newsletter application where users
can sign up for a subscription. It takes the user's information and adds it to a database. I
also added an admin page that allows one to view all the subscriptions.

### Car Insurance  
This project is also an MVC web application, and similarly to the newsletter application it
takes user information and adds it to a database. This application takes input from the user
and based on specific guidelines it calculates a quote based on business logic. The admin
view in this application also allows one to view all the customers that use the insurance,
including just specific pieces of the customer's information.
